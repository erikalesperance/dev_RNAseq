MAX_MIS=10

#	If greater than this value, read counted as "mapped to too many loci"

#	Name of Flowcell (or other name that differentiates a particular run, e.g. "Run1")
FLOWCELL_NAME="Run4"

# sequencing platform used
PLATFORM="ILLUMINA"

### Variables not shared with Collect_Junctions handler:

#	STAR outputs alignment in genome coordinates as well as transcript coordinates. The latter is used for
#	RSEM (step 7). If you plan on using the genomic coordinate alignment files for SNP calling, you will need 
#	sorted BAM files. If you want STAR to output genome alignments as sorted BAM files, put "yes" here. Note that this
#	increases the time it takes for read mapping to run. If "no", the genome alignment file will be an unsorted SAM.
GENOMIC_COORDINATE_BAMSORTED="yes"

#	The type of quantification requested
#	Either "TranscriptomeSAM" -outputs SAM/BAM alignments to transcriptome in a separate file
#	Or "GeneCounts" - read counts per gene
#	Can also put "-" for none
QUANT="GeneCounts"

#	2nd-pass read mapping will use junctions discovered in the first pass (Collect_Junctions)
#	This variable can be one of two options:
#		1.) The filtered junction list output from Collect_Junctions handler, OR
#		2.) If you have more than one filtered junction list (if Collect_Junctions was run with multiple sample groups),
#			this variable can be a text file listing the full file paths for each junction file you want included	
#	If not using additional junctions, leave blank
